# Wine type prediction

- We used machine learning and deep learning to solve wine type classification problem.
- We used a Logistic regression model and a Neural network model that we trained them on the winequality dataset (after we merged the red and white csv files)
- We got 99% accuracy with both models. More details in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/CherifYasmine/wine-quality-prediction/blob/main/wine-quality-prediction.ipynb)
